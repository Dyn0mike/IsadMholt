ASP.NET MVC project codename: The Corner Pub

Simple web site uses ASP.NET MVC to deliver a Database first web site. Access is simple with only the pubs menu being accessible till the user logs in. Making use of cookies and server side GUIDs, means no usernames or passwords are needed. Once logged in to the site users can choose to add products to their order and freely remove them, the database will be updated automatically. 
Administration is also easy with ASP’s controllers bringing up records from the database and allowing quick edits with out and need for any SQL code by the admin. Simple login and choose one of the three admin tasks. Adding a new item can be done in the “new items” menu, fill in details such as Category, Name or a URL for a picture stored on the server. Viewing customer orders can be done via “View Orders” menu, orders can be viewed and deleted. 

A list of up to 5 key features:

•	Simple design with a unified look and feel to the whole site.

•	Extremely simple admin, with minimal technical jargon.

•	Fast site with only 4 database tables and the use of cookies to store common items on the client.

•	Easy to expand site with MVC, all code is kept in the controllers, with only formatting code being stored in the view.

•	Very accessible with little to no use of images, screen readers and users with other needs will have no trouble using the site.

•	Works perfectly in both internet Explorer and firefox.
